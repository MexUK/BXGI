BXGI is an old project which was used in the IMG Factory project.

The GI in BXGI stands for GTA Interface.

BXGI contains file format handling for some versions of several GTA formats, including:

COL

DAT

DFF

IDE

IMG

IPL

RW

TXD

WDR

WTD

BXGI has not been updated to work with the newer MX project core, and thus BXGI will not compile unless modified.

Thanks to members of the GTA community for providing lots of information on GTA file formats.
